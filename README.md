# Re-Encode-Character
A repository for re-encoding ASCII characters to UNICODE characters

This is written in perl v5.22

The program re-encode was written for the conversion of ASCII characters of Indian Language "Tamil" to Unicode characters. There are many different Tamil fonts which enforce their own character mapping.

This is a generic software which requires you to map the Tamil Font manually first after which it can convert the tamil text to Unicode tamil text.

This program is still in development and is not yet complete.

If you want to use this program to convert other languages, the code of the sub-routine "map_font" has to be remastered as necessary.
